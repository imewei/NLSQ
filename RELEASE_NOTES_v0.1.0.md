## Next Steps for Publishing (DO NOT EXECUTE YET)

When ready to publish v0.1.0, execute these commands:

### 1. Create Git Tag
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for v0.1.0 release"
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release version 0.1.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.0
```

### 2. Rebuild with Tagged Version
```bash
make clean
python -m build
```

### 3. Upload to PyPI (Test First)
```bash
# Test PyPI first
python -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

# Production PyPI (when ready)
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

### 4. Create GitHub Release
- Go to https://github.com/imewei/NLSQ/releases/new
- Select the v0.1.0 tag
- Use the CHANGELOG.md content for release notes
- Attach the distribution files from dist/
- Publish release

## Important Notes
- Version is currently managed by setuptools-scm
- The actual v0.1.0 version will be set when the git tag is created
- Current builds show 0.0.post92 due to no tags being present
- All critical bugs have been fixed and tests are passing
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is fully operational

## Repository Status
- Main branch: clean
- Recent commits include test fixes, workflow optimizations, and bug fixes
- Ready for tagging and release
