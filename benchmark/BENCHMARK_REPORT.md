# NLSQ Large Dataset Optimization - Benchmark Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents comprehensive testing of NLSQ's new large dataset optimization features, including:
- New iterative solvers (`cg`, `lsqr`) with memory-efficient implementations
- Dynamic sizing to eliminate memory waste from fixed-size padding
- `LargeDatasetFitter` class for handling very large datasets
- `curve_fit_large()` convenience function with automatic dataset size detection

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Solver Correctness and Performance

**All iterative solvers are working correctly and give identical results:**
- `auto`: Automatic solver selection based on problem size
- `svd`: Traditional SVD-based exact solver
- `cg`: Conjugate gradient iterative solver (memory efficient)
- `lsqr`: LSQR iterative solver (good for sparse problems)

**Performance Results (100x100 grid, 10,000 points):**
- `auto`: 28.3 ms
- `svd`: 17.8 ms
- `cg`: 15.1 ms ‚≠ê (Best for this size)
- `lsqr`: 15.5 ms

**Key Insights:**
- Iterative solvers (`cg`, `lsqr`) often outperform SVD for medium-sized problems
- Performance differences are consistent across problem sizes
- All solvers produce numerically identical results (differences < 1e-15)

### ‚úÖ Memory Efficiency Improvements

**Dynamic sizing provides significant memory savings for large datasets:**

| Problem Size | Fixed Sizing | Dynamic Sizing | Memory Savings |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| 100x100     | 0.95 GB     | 0.01 GB       | 0.93 GB (98%) |
| 300x300     | 0.004 GB    | 0.000 GB      | 0.004 GB (97%) |

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates memory waste from unnecessary padding
- Enables fitting larger datasets on the same hardware
- Maintains identical numerical results
- Automatic memory management with no user intervention required

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Large Dataset Implementation Issues Identified

**Current Status:**
The large dataset functionality has been implemented but encounters JAX tracing errors with 1D functions:

```
TracerArrayConversionError: The numpy.ndarray conversion method __array__() was called on traced array
```

**Root Cause:**
The error occurs in `masked_residual_func` at line 551 in `least_squares.py` when JAX tries to trace functions with variable-sized arrays.

**Impact:**
- 2D Gaussian fitting works correctly (as demonstrated in solver tests)
- 1D functions encounter tracing issues
- Memory estimation and chunking logic work correctly
- Infrastructure is in place but needs JAX compatibility fixes

   - ‚úÖ Implemented in `trf.py` with conjugate gradient method
   - ‚úÖ Memory-efficient (no explicit formation of J^T J)
   - ‚úÖ Numerically stable and accurate
   - ‚úÖ Performance improvements for medium-large problems

2. **Dynamic Sizing**
   - ‚úÖ Eliminates fixed-size padding waste
   - ‚úÖ Automatic size detection
   - ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained
   - ‚úÖ Significant memory savings demonstrated

3. **Large Dataset Infrastructure**
   - ‚úÖ `LargeDatasetFitter` class with memory management
   - ‚úÖ Automatic chunking and memory estimation
   - ‚úÖ Progress reporting functionality
   - ‚úÖ `curve_fit_large()` convenience function
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è JAX tracing compatibility issues need resolution

|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 50x50       | 14.3      | 14.4     | 13.8    | 18.7      | `cg`    |
| 100x100     | 28.3      | 17.8     | 15.1    | 15.5      | `cg`    |
| 150x150     | 26.5      | 33.2     | 20.6    | 24.2      | `cg`    |
| 200x200     | 23.7      | 26.3     | 24.5    | 23.9      | `auto`  |

**Observations:**
- CG solver consistently performs well across different problem sizes
