## Key Findings from Profiling

### 1. Performance Breakdown

| Problem Size | Total Time | JIT Compilation | TRF Runtime | TRF % of Total |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Small (100 pts)** | 1,598ms | 900ms (56%) | 600ms (37%) | 37.5% |
| **Medium (1000 pts)** | 511ms | 383ms (75%) | 259ms (51%) | 50.7% |
| **Large (10000 pts)** | 642ms | 471ms (73%) | 312ms (49%) | 48.6% |
| **XLarge (50000 pts)** | 609ms | 452ms (74%) | 326ms (54%) | 53.5% |

**Critical Insight**:
- First run is dominated by JIT compilation (60-75% of time)
- Subsequent runs will be much faster due to caching
- TRF algorithm shows excellent scaling: **50x more data → only 1.26x slower**

### 2. Current Optimization State

**Already Optimized**:
- ✅ 51 `@jit` decorators present
- ✅ JAX-based linear algebra operations
- ✅ Efficient trust region updates
- ✅ Good numerical stability

**Missing Patterns**:
- ⚠️ `lax.scan` for iterative loops
- ⚠️ Minimal NumPy ↔ JAX conversions
- ⚠️ `@vmap` for vectorization

### 3. Identified Bottlenecks (from profiling)

1. **JIT Compilation**: 383-471ms (60-75% first run)
   - Cannot optimize further (one-time cost)
   - Already well-cached

2. **TRF Algorithm**: 259-326ms (40-50% total)
   - Inner loop: ~30-40% of TRF time
   - NumPy↔JAX conversions: ~10-15% of TRF time
   - Function/Jacobian evaluations: ~40% of TRF time (user-defined, cannot optimize)

3. **Minor Optimizations Available**:
   - 6 `np.array(jax_result)` conversions in hot paths
   - Potential for loop fusion

## Completed Optimizations

### 1. Benchmark Infrastructure ✅

**Created**: `benchmark/test_performance_regression.py`
- 9 benchmark groups (small/medium/large problems, algorithms, bounded optimization, etc.)
- pytest-benchmark integration for CI/CD
- Baseline measurements established

**Baseline Performance**:
- Small linear fit (100 pts): 468ms (first run with JIT)
- Medium exponential fit (1000 pts): 511ms
- Large Gaussian fit (10000 pts): 642ms
- XLarge polynomial fit (50000 pts): 609ms

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run benchmarks
pytest benchmark/test_performance_regression.py --benchmark-only

# Save baseline
pytest benchmark/test_performance_regression.py --benchmark-save=baseline

# Compare against baseline
pytest benchmark/test_performance_regression.py --benchmark-compare=baseline
```

### 2. Code Complexity Reduction ✅

**Refactored**: `nlsq/validators.py`
- **Before**: `validate_curve_fit_inputs` had complexity 62 (one of top 3 most complex functions)
- **After**: Complexity ~12 (extracted 12 helper methods)
- **Result**: Improved maintainability, testability, and readability

**Extracted Helper Methods** (12 total):
- `_validate_xdata_conversion`
- `_validate_ydata_conversion`
- `_validate_data_shapes`
- `_estimate_n_parameters`
- `_validate_parameter_count`
- `_check_degenerate_data`
- `_check_finite_values`
- `_validate_initial_parameters`
- `_validate_bounds`
- `_validate_sigma`
- `_test_function_callable`
- `_check_data_quality`

**Testing**: All 18 minpack tests pass, all 18 validation tests pass

### 3. Profiling Analysis ✅

**Created Documents**:
1. `benchmark/profile_trf_hot_paths.py` - Profiling script
2. `benchmark/trf_profiling_summary.md` - Detailed analysis
3. `benchmark/lax_scan_design.md` - Implementation design

**Key Findings**:
- Inner loop: 1-5 iterations typically (max 100)

## Optimization Opportunities & Realistic Expectations

### High Priority (Expected: 1.3-1.5x speedup)

#### 1. Reduce NumPy ↔ JAX Conversions
**Locations** (6 conversion points in hot paths):
- Line 894: `cost = np.array(cost_jnp)`
- Line 897: `g = np.array(g_jnp)`
- Line 968: `s, V, uf = (np.array(val) for val in svd_output[2:])`
- Line 997: `predicted_reduction = np.array(predicted_reduction_jnp)`
- Line 1018: `cost_new = np.array(cost_new_jnp)`
- Line 1068: `g = np.array(g_jnp)`

**Benefit**: 10-20% speedup
**Complexity**: Low
**Risk**: Low
**Recommendation**: **Implement this first** - easy win with low risk

#### 2. Inner Loop lax.scan (Complex)
**Benefit**: 1.2-1.3x speedup (not 2-5x as initially hoped)
**Complexity**: High
**Challenges**:
- Early termination logic (continue/break)
- Conditional solver selection (cg vs exact)
- Complex state management (10+ variables)
- Non-finite value handling

**Risks**:
- Increased JIT compilation time
- Potential numerical differences
- Significant implementation effort for modest gains

**Recommendation**: **Defer** - complexity outweighs benefits

### Medium Priority (Expected: 1.1-1.2x speedup)

#### 3. Vectorize Quadratic Evaluations
**Benefit**: Small improvement from batching
**Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Recommendation**: Consider after conversion optimization

### Lower Priority

#### 4. Outer Loop Optimization
**Benefit**: Minimal (outer loop only 5-20 iterations)
**Complexity**: Very High
**Recommendation**: **Not recommended** - high effort, low reward

## Revised Performance Expectations

### Initial Projection (from Multi-Agent Report)
- 5-20x performance improvement
- Based on assumption of many unoptimized patterns

### Reality (from Profiling)
- Code is **already highly optimized**
- JAX operations are already JIT-compiled
- Main bottlenecks are:
  - JIT compilation (one-time cost, cannot optimize)
  - User function evaluations (cannot optimize)
  - NumPy↔JAX conversions (can optimize)

### Realistic Targets

**Phase 1 Optimizations** (NumPy↔JAX conversions):
- **Conservative**: 1.1-1.2x speedup on TRF runtime
- **Target**: 1.2-1.3x speedup
- **Optimistic**: 1.3-1.5x speedup

**If Adding lax.scan** (high complexity):
- **Conservative**: 1.3-1.5x total speedup
- **Target**: 1.5-1.8x total speedup
- **Optimistic**: 1.8-2.2x total speedup

**Overall recommendation**: Focus on low-hanging fruit (conversions) rather than complex transformations with uncertain benefits.

Large (10000 pts):    642ms (312ms TRF + 471ms JIT)
XLarge (50000 pts):   609ms (326ms TRF + 452ms JIT)
```

### Expected After NumPy↔JAX Optimization
```
Small (100 pts):    1,540ms (560ms TRF + 900ms JIT)   - 3.6% faster
Medium (1000 pts):    480ms (220ms TRF + 383ms JIT)   - 6.1% faster
Large (10000 pts):    605ms (270ms TRF + 471ms JIT)   - 5.8% faster
